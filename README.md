# Deep Learning for Localization of White Matter Lesions in Neurological Diseases
This is the official repository for the paper "Deep Learning for Localization of White Matter Lesions in Neurological Diseases", presented at the Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference 2025.

## Description
White Matter Lesions are commonly observed as hyperintensities on FLAIR MRIs or hypointensities on T1-weighted images and associated with neurological diseases. The spatial distribution of these lesions is linked to an increased risk of developing neurological conditions, emphasizing the need for location-based analyses. This study proposes deep learning-based methods for automated WM lesion segmentation and localization.
